## Dependencies
### pipenv
pipenv is a dependency management tool for Python that allows creating and managing isolated virtual environments for projects, ensuring that dependencies are consistent and easy to manage.

To install pipenv, run:
```
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

Then, to install pipenv on your project directory, run:
```
$ pipenv install
```

And finally, to activate your new virtual environment, run:
```
$ pipenv shell
```

---

To install any of the following dependencies on your project **virtual environment**, run:
```
$ pipenv install <name>
```
and replace `<name>` with the correct dependecy name.

If you're not using pipenv or any kind of virtual environment, do the same thing, but with:
```
$ pip install <name>
```
